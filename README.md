# Lean4-Board-Game

This is a board game made by Yuntian Liu based on the techniques of tactic proof in Lean 4 language. The original intention is to help those new to Lean to quickly grasp how to use the tactics to prove FOL propositions, and it may has the potential to interest people not yet familiar with Lean. 

The design of the cards are released, and you may make your own cards as long as: 

1. You do not make profit with the cards.
2. You acknowledge that the original design is made by SJTU AI4Math Team by not changing the back of the cards. 

The detailed rules are still under refinery, and you may redesign the rules yourself.
